SquirrelofLIL,,,"[{'author': Redditor(name='Anonymous_fiend'), 'body': 'Ngl kids may not be an option. Your fertility steeply declines starting at 35. By the time you find a decent man and marry him it might be too late. IVF is out of your budget with your stated income since it often takes multiple cycles to have one come to term. However, being a step mom is a great option. Many divorced men and single fathers would make great husbands. Also btw kids are a lot of work for even nt people. Prepare to get over stimulated constantly. Working, disability, a ltr, and a disabled child might be too much. \n\n\nDefine visibly autistic? I have autism and adhd but I guess don‚Äôt look it bc pretty privilege. Harsh reality is men are visual and smv is important. It‚Äôs not what gets a man to commit but it gives you more opportunities to find a decent man. Luckily most of female beauty is controllable. \n\n\nYou‚Äôre gonna need to be realistic with yourself. Not saying to settle but don‚Äôt price yourself out of the market with too narrow of standards. NYC is notoriously hard for women to find good husbands. If you‚Äôre religious go to services and events hosted by your community. You being with one man until he passed and having no kids yet is definitely a plus. If not religious, find a community to meet like minded people. This could be a board game, ren faire, dnd, hobby, etc group. If you drink (or don‚Äôt just order an app or something) try trivia night or some social mixer at a bar. Ideally go out and do a lot of social things with a friend. Or go to a meetup.com outing. Online dating (not tinder) is a good idea too. \n\n\nBtw most men would want to share a room and bed with you.

A smart guy will ask you what you are reading to strike up a conversation.\n\nOf course dating apps are always an option but I feel like you might do better in real life if there are disabilities involved.

Jesus had empathy and discouraged mere humans from judging one another. It's a stunning example to live up to, and so hard. But Christians are called to do hard things. \n\nSo understand 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 -- *Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.* \n\nReread the gospels, paying particular attention to what Jesus does and says. Notice him as the Great Teacher, notice him as the Physician.\n\nWhen you read about a woman's submission in Ephesians, notice not just this: \n\n*Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.*\n\nBut this: \n\n*In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body.*\n\nYour husband made you one flesh with him.

Remember that it is not our place to judge the hearts of others, that‚Äôs God‚Äôs job. When you find yourself losing empathy for your husband, take a step back and 1) ask God to help you surrender and not try to take His place as the judge, and 2) pray for your husband. Like even if you don‚Äôt feel like it, if you‚Äôre annoyed at him or whatever, force yourself to pray for him. This will help you to be closer to both God and your husband! \n\nI would also advise, if you‚Äôre having a hard time changing and feel your husband is getting frustrated, ask him if you two can pray together. In general it‚Äôs always good to pray with and for your spouse. It helps you see each other as children of God, not yet perfect but growing in holiness. Part of your role as a Christian wife is to help your husband grow in Christ, as it is also his job to help you do the same. When you mess up, but sincerely apologize and try to make amends, you are giving your husband to practice forgiveness. And when he messes up, it‚Äôs your turn to forgive. The passage I referenced explicitly states that as we forgive others, so will we be forgiven. God‚Äôs love for us is described as a father (and some places a mother) loving a child. If your kids mess up, you may be disappointed and and upset, but you never stop loving them. You always want the best for them. Have confidence that God feels the same way about you, and it seems so does your husband! \n\nFinally, practice gratitude. When you expect to be shunned and your husband shows love instead, tell him ‚Äúthank you for loving/forgiving me‚Äù. It‚Äôs good to apologize when you have done wrong, but ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for xyz‚Äù puts the focus on your mistake, while thanking him shows that you acknowledge and accept his forgiveness. If you are expecting him to withdraw, he probably knows that you are aware you did something wrong. Thanking him shifts your mindset from waiting for the punishment you think you deserve, to basking in the love you know you don‚Äôt deserve. The more you allow yourself to feel loved unconditionally by both your husband and God, the more you will be able to show unconditional love to others. And remember, our Christian journey is a gradual process. Give yourself grace when you mess up, ask the Holy Spirit to help you love and forgive, and keep trying! 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 is a beautiful passage, especially verse 8: ‚ÄúLove never fails‚Äù.

We have had many struggles in our relationship and have managed to navigate through them. 

One thing that is consistently a problem, though, is how my upbringing has affected my behaviors and outlook. I have a tendency to be highly independent, opinionated, argumentative, and judgemental. Before I met my husband, I would have never admitted these things, nor would I have agreed (except for being independent). I constantly struggle with RPW and traditional Christian marriage values because I was not raised that way at ALL. 

I can see my husbands perspective on all of these things now and how they are not beneficial to our relationship. Unfortunately, these habits of mine come up and I frequently feel justified in my ways. 

For example - when I feel my husbands reaction to something is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù I lose my ability to have empathy for him and I go to a judgmental place. This is what was modeled for me when I was a child, and unfortunately, it feels appropriate. I also expect to be shunned when I ‚Äúact out‚Äù or ‚Äúmisbehave‚Äù when I‚Äôm sad or upset and am surprised when I am comforted instead. 

My husband hates it, and I can completely understand why, but I don‚Äôt know how to change it. He says it‚Äôs conditional love, and he‚Äôs not interested in conditional love. I understand and I want to improve, but I don‚Äôt know where to start.

Regardless, when I met my boyfriend I definitely had much more liberal views and values but I have become more conservative/ middle leaning throughout the relationship. I\'m just not 100% there yet. For example, while I\'d love to be a SAHM when my children are young, I also think I\'d want to go back to work eventually. \n\n""Submission"" is more about me being able to follow his leadership *happily*. I\'ve shown hesitancy with this and while I\'ve always eventually followed his decisions I struggle with accepting them fully which have lead to arguments/ resentment.

I\'m ashamed to admit it but I maintained a friendship with someone I had a history with and never told my partner until he asked. Obviously he was very upset and this greatly affected his trust and respect towards me. I\'m actually very glad now that he found me when he did because without him I\'m scared of what type of path I would have gone down with such a liberal mindset. The way he reacted and treated me/ the situation resulted in me losing some trust/ feelings of safety towards him. He also had brief interactions with other women during the especially rough patches in our relationship which he was immediately remorseful over but has obviously affected the trust between us further. We\'ve been trying to regain trust and respect ever since with varying success. \n\nThe only reason I\'m more worried about myself regaining trust and respect back rather than him is so that I can feel more secure in his leadership which in turn I believe would make him happier and perhaps allow him to be more trusting/ respectful towards me. I know I can\'t control what he does or feels so I\'m hoping that by focusing on my part and doing everything I can that this will foster an environment for him to then regain trust and respect.

I'll try not to ramble and any advice would be appreciated. 

Background: my boyfriend (28M) and I (20F) have been together for 2 years now. We've had quite a few struggles but he's always been adamant that we should work through them. He is very much redpill oriented/ conservative while I really wasn't when we first met. However, instead of wanting to go our separate ways, he encouraged me to change as he explained I was simply a bit young and hadn't grown up in the right way to have/ appreciate a more conservative lifestyle. Although reluctant at first, I think I've made good progress in adapting my views. I'm by no means perfect and it is a bit of a sore point in our relationship but something I'm still working on. And this sub has especially helped!

Unfortunately, certain issues have caused us to lose trust in one another and as an extension, respect. At first it was him who really didn't trust me and despite trying to work through it, other situations have occurred that have also made me lose my trust in him. The way both of us have acted at times due to our lack of trust has lead to me feeling disrespected despite his assurances that he does respect me. And despite never outright saying it, I feel that there are times where he also feels disrespected. 

I've accepted that we might never trust or respect one another 100% again. And I think we could still make it work like that. But unfortunately I think that applies more to him than it does to me (ie. it would be okay for him to never trust or respect me fully again) due to set up of more redpill oriented relationships. He wants me to submit to him and his leadership which I've tried to do and am trying to do but I feel like I'm unable to because of my lack of trust in him. This makes sense to me, as how are you supposed to submit to someone and allow them to make decisions in your relationship's best interest if you don't trust them?

I know I need to forgive him for past hurts and move on from this anger and resentment I feel in order to strengthen our relationship and make it work. But I am really struggling to do so. I don't know how to just 'let go' and trust or forgive. And there don't seem to be any specific relationship exercises that facilitate this. We've tried counselling almost a year ago now but it wasn't really helpful.

I simply want to ask about our intimate/sex life.

Physical touch is the love language of both of us.

He literally kisses me hundreds of times a day, hugs, and any gesture to show how much he loves me both in our room and in front of the family. 

I love him to bits. I feel so attracted to him. We both dont have high libidos individually but whenever I'm in his arms, I want him to proceed to sex. I don't know why. He's here for the weekend only and I can't get enough of him. When he's away for the week the thought of sex doesn't even cross my mind, he otherwise will joke about it on phone.

When he comes home, he immediately wants it, and it's the only time he'll proceed. We have it about 3 times on Saturday sunday, and almost ALWAYS, it's me, just impulsively ask him to have it when I'm lying with him.

He almost always does it lovingly, but immediately after it, I feel regret, a weird kind of, that it's a reverse role. It's men who ask for sex always or atleast mostly. And I know even when he's in deel sleep while changing side he'll kiss me and cuddle me. But not sex. It's like his love is so pure, and mine is tinged with this continous want of sex.

I need advice. I can really control myself if I'm overreacting in it. I don't want to ruin anything or make him feel I'm always too available.",Pure vs dirty love?,0.91

Women in good relationship make better choices and research supports this (research was on marriage/no marriage so 'good' relationship is subjective).

WorldlyHalf4389,,,"[{'author': Redditor(name='flower_power_g1rl'), 'body': 'This is highly iffy. Insults can stem from a wide range of causes. The person is used to hearing insults in their family or culture, the person was verbally abused in the past, the person is angry temporarily, the person speaks lowly to themselves in their head, the person has low social awareness, the person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or the person is sadistic or looking to hurt others for attention/domination. **All of the cases except for the last two are issues of communication**. The last two (**alcohol/drugs, sadism/need for domination) are telltale signs that** ***any relationship with this person is not safe.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\nTW abuse\n\nIn my family, my mother has narcissistic personality disorder and for many years was abusive to my father and all of her children. I have been called retarded, ugly, fugly, fugly bitch, and probably more that I cannot access now. My parents also shouted at one another at home a lot. How do I know that I\'m better? Because I don\'t live with them anymore, and I\'ve been much calmer. Anyway - due to that family pattern, I can be sensitive to insults or when a person raises their voice.\n\nI remember I was with a man for one year. He was trying very hard to be a good partner despite his personal difficulties and lack of experience. He too was verbally and physically abused in childhood. During that year, when he got angry in an argument he sometimes called me labels. For him, these labels are not insulting but I felt insulted. In fact, I remember to this day what he called me: he called me childish, mean, selfish, crazy. Each of these words he had said only one time, and he said them during the height of his anger. **After the arguments I was able to find my backbone and listen to my gut** which told me *""These words indicate a lack of respect.""* If your gut says something is wrong, then it is. The tricky part is how to pass this information on to others.\n\nAfter the arguments, **I calmly explained to him that in my mind, childish, mean, selfish and crazy are words of disrespect. I told him, I understand that we all say wrong things when we are angry.** But I was insulted by these particular words. If by ""childish"" he means I did not behave in the way he expected, that is fine. If by ""mean"" he means I was not considerate of his needs, that is fine. If ""selfish"" means I was putting myself first, that is fine. If ""crazy"" meant he couldn\'t understand and I was stressing him out, that is fine. But once a person learns to better communicate why they felt wronged by you, even when they are angry instead of quickly putting labels on you as a person, the relationship will become safer.

For example in a fight where either one of you or both of you are at the height of your anger. However, it is most likely a sign of poor communication. Ideally it should happen once or twice (really not at all) and then it should be discussed in a civil manner on how to communicate better and more respectfully the next time an argument arises. \n\nI think it also depends on the type of insult. They\'re all bad, but is it something more generic (""you\'re acting like a b\\*"") or is it something more personalized or just something that actually hurts you quite deeply. You have to decide what insult is what. Some might not accept any insult and find all of them hurtful. Others might be able to accept (once or twice) a generic insult said in anger that was simply poor communication (flower\\_power\\_g1rl explains this better than I am). It really depends. I think one is a sign of anger (generic insults) while the other (personalized/ deeply hurtful) is a sign of bigger underlying issues. A personal example: my partner has called me a b\\*. While insulting and a bit hurtful, I can admit that okay, perhaps I was acting like one and yes he was angry and you know what, I can accept and get over that. Another time he called me a word that describes... a lady of the night... and was quite explicit with it. This to me was very hurtful. But it related to my past which is an underlying issue in our relationship that we\'re working on.\n\nAnother sign that I think indicates these insults are due to underlying issues is if they\'re occurring frequently alongside more neutral arguments. (Or really if you\'re just having the same arguments with the same insults over and over again). Also if you\'re expecting the same insults from him each time you argue. Then I think it definitely crosses over into the territory of ""this is an underlying issue in the relationship that my partner is really struggling with"".\n\nSo, I think causes: anger, underlying relationship issues, poor communication, a combination.\n\nHow to navigate it: I\'m still figuring this out for myself! BUT, I think for one thing the insults need to stop, there needs to be an improvement in the communication during arguments, any sort of underlying issue needs to be addressed AND you need to fully forgive them and not hold the insults against them or **yourself**.

LoveWitchXo,,SELF IMPROVEMENT,"[{'author': Redditor(name='StrangestUnicorn'), 'body': 'Am I correct to assume that this broken trust is related to his porn use?\n\nI see that you posted on ""loveafterporn"" subreddit. I have a lot of thoughts about that place, and none of them are positive. There is undeniably a great temptation to have one\'s feelings validated, for the pain to be heard and understood. But that does not make indulging in that temptation healthy or constructive.\n\nI\'ll share two quotes from your posts there:\n\n> Our sex life has decreased so much. I just asked him the other day how was he doing with porn. He told me good! 2 days later I catch him. Why cant we be a happy romantic couple. He wonders why im always having an upset mood.\n\n> Broke down yesterday after ‚Äúsex‚Äù he literally got soft inside of me [...] Feel embarrassed and insecure about myself? Im done. I broke down out of frustration and told him he needs to fix this FOR REAL. this time or our relationship is going to be ruined. He tried to act like NOTHING was wrong!!!!!! Im so pissed how can they sit and just ignore the problem. I deserve good sex. I deserve to not feel humiliated. I deserve a man who will put in the effort for me and TRY not just ignore this very obvious problem.\n\nAlthough this post was not intended to address porn, it still conceptually applies: [Jealousy and the secret weapon against the forbidden fruit: honey](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/az46d6/jealousy_and_the_secret_weapon_against_the/):\n\n> To paint out a common scenario: A couple has been in an LTR for an extended period of time and she notices that there is a girl texting him, making advances towards him, and exhibiting all-around flirtatious behavior that makes her uncomfortable about the whole ordeal.\n\n> The first gut reaction of many women is to yell, be controlling, go through his phone, start drama with the girl directly, or confront either party about it. Even if she doesn\'t do any if these, she makes her animosity known because she\'s bitter about the mere mention of that other girl.\n\n> Exhibiting these types of jealous behaviors does not work. Plain and simple. Nobody wants to be yelled at, have their privacy invaded, or deal with drama. Acting out this way can make a man think things like ""My girlfriend is extremely controlling and crazy, why am I with her?""\n\nThis passage reflects your current approach to dealing with the ""forbidden fruit"" aka porn: expressions of jealousy and drama.\n\nTo get a bit technical, there are four factors that make sex appealing to men: Physical attractiveness, sexual novelty, emotional intimacy, and feeling desired. We have to be realistic and admit that there is no woman in the world who can compete with porn on the first two factors. Even more so for long term relationships, as novelty [wears off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect) after the honeymoon phase, and physical attractiveness naturally decreases with age. For any woman, maintaining long term sexual attractiveness to her husband requires an ability to appeal to emotional intimacy and feeling desired.\n\nAnd this is why I find the ""loveafterporn"" approach to ""beating"" porn counterproductive. Even if it is effective at forcing your partner to stop consuming porn, it does so by severely damaging emotional intimacy and feeling desired, which only leaves him sexually frustrated, making a relapse back into porn almost inevitable.\n\nIf my math is right, these porn and sex life problems started right around the time your honeymoon phase has ended. That is not a coincidence. The appeal to sexual novelty not being as strong as it was in the beginning is a natural and expected change, and it is unfair to blame him for it. The fact that this had such an acute effect on your sex life shows that you did not get a very high grade on your ""[Final Exam](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4gfzqa/the_final_exam/)"". You have to fight the forbidden fruit with honey, i.e. the advantages you have over it: build emotional intimacy and feeling desired, which starts with not expressing negative emotions if you see him engaging with the forbidden fruit, or not being able to perform in the bedroom.\n\nI understand that ""improving your mood"" is the point of your post. But I do not think we can address it in a vacuum, other than prescribing the generic ""self care"" and ""STFU"" (not that they are bad). A better approach is to tackle the causes of your sour mood. I understand that from your perspective, your sour moods are caused by his lacking sexual desire for you, but you also have to remember that the reverse is true as well: his lacking sexual desire is caused by your sour mood. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle. Deep down you know that you are upset not at his porn use or lack of sex, but lack of desire for you, and that him obligating himself to not watch porn and take Viagra and perform regular ""duty sex"" with you will not fix your emotional wants. If the cycle is to break, the change must come from you.\n\nI think the only effective way to improve this situation is for you to fundamentally shift the burden of responsibility onto yourself: instead of thinking of yourself as a victim (""his porn use and low sex drive makes me moody and insecure""), think of yourself as an agent of change (""my insecurities and sour mood destroys emotional intimacy and feeling desired and makes him choose porn over sex with me""). Even if this perspective is not entirely true, making oneself believe to be responsible for causing this situation as well as having the tools needed to fix it, gives you the mental tools necessary to be in control of your mood and emotions, as opposed to being emotionally reactive to the sexual and emotional validation (or lack of it) that your partner gives you.\n\nOne last thing I want to mention is his performance anxiety. In your posts you have been repeatedly expressing grievances at him for recently being ""semi hard"" and ""going soft"" and that he should ""put more effort"". I know you are his first sex partner, but is he yours? A bit of unsolicited sex ed: men cannot make ""effort"" to get and stay hard. In fact such efforts, being in one\'s head concerned about performance, creates anxiety that makes it even less likely he will be able to perform, less likely he will enjoy sex, and less likely he will want to do it again. I do not know enough to comment with certainty, but the impression I get is that when this problem started a few months ago, your response to it has been far from ideal. And I suspect that this is a big part of why he is now less eager to have sex with you.\n\nI know this is a rambly answer. I wish I had more time to write a better one.

Not true in every case, but true in most. \n\nYou say he got soft while you were having sex. Okay. You give him attitude, you stress him out, and you seem to be more worried about yourself.

You also have to accept the possibility that he'll never get over it. People like watching it, especially men. It's possible that he could break this addiction, but it's just as possible that he can't. Same with any other addiction.\n\nOne recommendation I would make is to examine how you feel about it. You're obviously very against it, but why? Unless it's exploitation, there really is nothing wrong with it, right? It's just sex work. Now I understand if you have a problem with him watching it while he's in a relationship with you and I understand how it could make you feel is though you aren't good enough. However, have you ever considered watching it with him? Do you even know what kind of porn he watches?\n\nI would say, so long as it isn't anything gross or problematic like pseudo noncon or whatever, then try watching it with him sometime. Maybe even try working your way toward acting out the scene with him while you watch it together. Give him a handjob or blowjob while he's watching.\n\nMen in relationships who watch porn do so for a variety of reasons. The most common is a lack of intimacy, which as you've explained is not the problem. Another big issue is because he can watch things in porn that his wife or girlfriend isn't willing to do. Seems to me that you might be willing to try some things. So try them! I can absolutely 100% percent guarantee you that your boyfriend is not vanilla. As a comedian has said, men are only as freaky as they believe they are allowed to be. They're going to be as kinky as they possibly can without crossing the line. So consider moving the line üòâ\n\nWould you feel comfortable telling me what types of things the two of you do in the bedroom? You don't have to go into extreme detail, but things like how vanilla or not vanilla it is, what types of positions you try, how frequently the two of you perform oral, if anal has ever been on the table or proposed and whether or not you've accepted, things like that.\n\nVery big important question here, do you praise his performance during and after, or just after? Because if there's one thing that a lot of men absolutely love it's being told how well they're doing. You'll see this a lot in pornography. The woman will constantly be talking about how good it feels, how well he's fucking her, asking him to go harder or deeper. To be completely honest, a lot of the actresses take it too far and it just becomes cringy. Balance lies in all things. But if this isn't something that you're doing, give it a try. You might be surprised. And it's not just words, your arms and legs and hands can convey the same messages. Grab him, scratch him, wrap your legs around his waist and squeeze, use your feet to pull him in each time he thrusts. These are the types of things that let a guy know how good he's doing, and it is very important. Because, despite some stereotypes that exist regarding men getting off and then going to sleep and all that nonsense, a lot of men place a lot of importance on how well they perform in the bedroom. It's a confidence versus insecurity type thing, just like penis size. If they don't feel like they're performing well, it affects their confidence. I know it can often seem like the guy is just in it to get a quick nut and be done, but I really don't think that's the case for your guy. If you don't already praise him in this way, you'll probably be very pleasantly surprised how much of an effect it can have.\n\nIf you're already doing all of these things and it's not really making much of a difference, or hasn't made much of a difference up to this point, then we might need to brainstorm a little bit.\n\nEdit: spelling"", 'created_utc': 1690749645.0, 'edited': 1690751867.0, 'id': 'ju499fr', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_15cx7n1', 'parent_id': 't1_ju46w99', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15cx7n1/ive_lost_myself_and_need_help/ju499fr/', 'score': 2, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='LoveWitchXo'), 'body': 'I swear‚Ä¶I have done everything you already listed. :(', 'created_utc': 1690756198.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'ju4ojc2', 'is_submitter': True, 'link_id': 't3_15cx7n1', 'parent_id': 't1_ju499fr', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15cx7n1/ive_lost_myself_and_need_help/ju4ojc2/', 'score': 1, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='Druidwannabetbh'), 'body': 'Including watching the porn with him?

As you get older, I think you‚Äôll come to understand it certain conventions are beneficial when it comes to social situations.  For example, in general, when I am communicating with the female partner of a couple, particularly if they are married, I will include the husband on the texts.

That'd be the end of that. And it goes both ways. The reason is that it protects both parties in a relationship from being put into a situation that could lead to distrust or cheating. A bunch of guys going out with one female and possibly alcohol involved is irresponsible. Youre setting yourself up for failure. It happens all the time to people who think it cant happen to them. Specifically, those are the people it happens to, exclusively, people who think they'll be the exception. \n\nI think your boyfriends boundary is reasonable and protective of your relationship and frankly, of you. Men understand how men think. Your boyfriend knows that all of those men would get in your pants given the opportunity. Add some alcohol to lower your defenses and no bf around to protect you, its only a matter of time before one of them either seduces you or rapes you. Its exceedingly common. Your girl friends are naive. Life's hard, but it's harder when you're stupid. Don't make it unnecessarily harder. \n\nIn fact, now would be a good time to hash out all boundaries regarding the opposite sex with your boyfriend. Lay down the ground rules and abide by them.

I remember when me and my wife were just in our early relationship phase - we were serious too. It was like ""pretending"" to be married, seeing how it would go. Let me ask you this - Could you imagine a future where your spouse is going on dates and having opposite sex people sleeping over on the couch when you\'re not there? That would not be acceptable in any household I\'m aware of, and I\'m on the liberal west coast. So you\'re setting a tone. What kind of timeline are you on? Are you slow playing the commitment? First id consider if your timeline matches with your boyfriend\'s or whether or not you actually like him.\n\nI was taught growing up that men in relationships act responsibly by avoiding situations that can easily turn romantic with ""other"" women. That\'s like wearing a seatbelt, just a common sense thing that normal men do everyday. I\'ll just tell you what it\'s like to be a man. If a man is alone with an attractive woman and she decides she wants him right then, most men\'s brains turn to spectator mode. Thats a hard situation to get out of for any man. Too much hormones and nature working against us. If that\'s a married guy, his mistakes were all the romancing and finding a private place that led up to the final step, not the act itself necessarily. So you\'re basically contemplating putting guys into a situation where they would probably like to get to some romance and smooching. \n\nSo that\'s normal advise that young men should be getting. If you see men who disrespect those basic rules, that\'s strikes against them right there. But your BF plays by those rules and expects you to do the same. That\'s normal and good, he\'s really trying to bring you along even if you weren\'t ever taught this stuff in your upbringing e.g. at church or whatever.\n\nRegarding the bruh who asked for your number over and over, that you\'re wanting to go on a date with - what do you think that\'s all about? You think he understands the word ""no?"" I\'d consider breaking contact from that guy immediately.\n\nCouch surfing bruh - if he\'s a good friend he\'d understand about propriety of not sleeping over when your in a relationship. That\'s just too far. If he\'s a good friend, have him tag along as a third wheel with your BF and see how it goes. 90% likely he just wants you.\n\nLast I want to say - it\'s not clear how real this relationship is. Your BF seems to want to play the serious game, but you\'re playing around. That\'s your choice, just be aware that\'s the choice you\'re making. He seems very patient to me to be putting up with this. I never had to explain any of this to my now-wife, and she was pretty inexperienced relationship-wise. Sorry for being blunt about that. But on the other hand, if you don\'t like him for whatever reason, just cut him loose, I\'d say. He\'s not the type to play around it doesn\'t sound like, so save both of yourselves some heartache if you\'re not ready for settling down.', 'created_utc': 1690699461.0, 'edited': 1690700611.0, 'id': 'ju1lvs8', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_15cf3l1', 'parent_id': 't3_15cf3l1', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15cf3l1/is_my_boyfriend_controlling_because_he_says_i/ju1lvs8/', 'score': 1, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='velveteen08'), 'body': 'it not a case of i don‚Äôt love my boyfriend. i do. i‚Äôm just scared to be hurt because i have before and i try to work on it and get better but i struggle to say no because i don‚Äôt know how to. my life is very complicated and my parents were abusive and also i have abusive relationship afterwards and i was betrayed‚Ä¶ is not excuse i know \n\nmy brain it don‚Äôt think like how others brains think‚Ä¶ i treat my boyfriend well. he says to me all the time he‚Äôs happy to be with me and he appreciate how i love him because i try to be good girlfriend really i do but sometimes i feel i do wrong i would never cheat my boyfriend ever but i see that i am crossing his boundaries and i need to be respectful to my boyfriend if i want to continue our relationship. i feel awful now even contemplating this all and listening to my friends when they don‚Äôt even understand my relationship.\n\nmy boyfriend he is very good to me. he treat me well and take care of me and he don‚Äôt ever speak to another girl. he also give me password to his phone and even allow me to put my face id on his phone he says to me he has nothing to hide. even me i let him do the same but he never go on my phone he says to me that he trusts me‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt want to lose that trust. i don‚Äôt know if i should apologize to him for being stupid üò≠', 'created_utc': 1690701965.0, 'edited': 1690702150.0, 'id': 'ju1p4xq', 'is_submitter': True, 'link_id': 't3_15cf3l1', 'parent_id': 't1_ju1lvs8', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15cf3l1/is_my_boyfriend_controlling_because_he_says_i/ju1p4xq/', 'score': 2, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='cornhole740269'), 'body': ""You sound like a good lady and he seems nice too, at least to me.

i told them that my boyfriend is not abusive or controlling and he treat me well because really he does. he takes care of me and tries to make me happy. it is the first time i have felt loved and cared for by a man. 

some people they told me that my boyfriend is controlling and i should break up and i feel that now i have questions of whether he is the right guy for me if he is controlling. i love my boyfriend and i don‚Äôt want us to break up over this but i don‚Äôt know if im sure anymore 

the story is that my boyfriend said that he will feel i disrespect him if i go out alone with guy friends and he will not accept it. 

do you think it‚Äôs controlling for him to act like this? i don‚Äôt know if this is controlling behavior really i‚Äôm worried",is my boyfriend controlling because he says i can‚Äôt go out alone with guy friends? must i break up with him?,0.36

It‚Äôs at least one factor as to why there‚Äôs been a slight change in this sub. I agree that it‚Äôs a turn off. But frankly, even frugality and minimalism can only take you so far depending on your situation. From what I‚Äôve seen, the way couples who aren‚Äôt wealthy or lucky enough to have help from family make it work is moving to a cheaper area and pinching pennies for a long time. I personally know families that are on food stamps + EBT to make it work in nice-ish suburbs so that mom can stay home with the kids, for example.  \n\nI think some clarification in your post is necessary though, OP. I don‚Äôt know if you meant you earn around the same amount as your SO, or if you both work the same amount, or all of that in conjunction with housework. Because it is true that women tend to do more housework regardless. \n\nI have my own conspiratorial view of why women were encouraged to enter the work force decades ago, but I think now it‚Äôs like, a lot of women feel like that literally do not have any other choice, whether because of the economy or how they feel about men or dating etc. So to me it‚Äôs incredibly obvious rather than puzzling why even in traditional spaces, we have people advocating for 50/50 relationships (as long as I understand your question correctly).', 'created_utc': 1690587065.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'jtvgn15', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_15c5gyy', 'parent_id': 't3_15c5gyy', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15c5gyy/what_is_your_opinion_on_5050_relationships/jtvgn15/', 'score': 11, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='Karlor_Gaylord_Cries'), 'body': '""but I think now it‚Äôs like, a lot of women feel like that literally do not have any other choice""\n\nYou\'re dam straight on that.

Only thing I disagree with is the ""boyfriend gets sex."" Yall have sex. The two of you. Not one doing a favor for the other, ideally. Men don\'t *just* want sex, they want you to like it. They want you to need them. This involves knowing your body, your likes and kinks, exploring continually with your partner, and asking for what you want. Most women, even really promiscuous ones, still struggle with repression and feeling like sex is ""for men."" Their orgasms are secondary, their participation is minimal, and that honestly comes across to men as disinterest. Just by breaking that mold, you can level up in a mans mind. Men in hookup culture might be selfish, but men in love really crave approval, they want to please, a natural urge because they want to keep you around and *keep* you, exclusively, and in order to feel like they can do that, they need to feel like they have all the access codes to your orgasms and are qualified for the job. So I would encourage women not to ""give"" sex but to really have it. Be more selfish about it. And you dont have to be in the mood like you said. The mood can be jumpstarted when you know yourself and teach your partner how you like to be seduced. This is the man you love, the only person you can have sex with, someone trusted who wants to please you. Unleash on him. It\'ll melt his brain, he\'ll be thanking you and buying you gifts like you did something for him. Men are great like that.

Throw in stress, obligations, and anything else the modern world throws at our mental load, it‚Äôs more than normal to not always want to when he does.\n\nChanging your perspective on what sex means, especially to men, means we can choose to engage in sex with our man when he wants it because we know what it means to him. To men, sex is love, connection, and all that good stuff. Men crave it and we control it. Sex is a great way to deepen the intimate bond with your man and further incentivize him to do his manly duties for you (provide and protect). So sometimes this means getting it done even when we‚Äôre not into it. If you know you‚Äôre rarely in the mood, imagine how constant rejection might affect your man.

The other poster gave you a good script to use if you want to put overt effort into discouraging him from having flings. Your other option is to not say anything and use the continued presence of these contacts as a gauge of his seriousness.\n* If he\'s committed to no more flings, he would spontaneously delete these contacts because they don\'t serve him. Unfortunately this is not a good sign about how genuine he is being right now. Did he readily agree to drop the flings, or did it require a lot of ""discussions"" before he acquiesced? \n* Securing commitment never ends for anyone, monogamously married or not. There\'s [a reply I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/13938ci/how_to_come_to_terms_with_male_sexuality/jj71wt0/?context=3) to a woman who had agreed to a non-monogamous arrangement prior to marriage, and then quickly realized she hated it when the reality hit. The gist of the practical, overlapping advice:\n\n1. The most effective way to secure commitment is by removing his physical ability to have sex with others, or at least not many others. If you\'re having sex multiple times a day, he quite literally won\'t be able to pursue any flings. This will require seductive efforts on your part.\n2. Sexual variety is not the end-all to be-all of life for men, even though it can be an all-encompassing desire if they feel they lack it. Most likely, at some point he\'ll find a higher purpose in life he wants to commit all his extra energy and drive to, rather than various women. Continue to put the effort into [being a good ""first mate""](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/wiki/index/tableofcontents/#wiki_the_rpw_lifestyle), which will encourage the progression of this timeline from giving extra energy to women to giving extra energy to a higher purpose.\n3. You need to decide on an STD testing schedule for yourself. Unfortunately your husband\'s mixed behavior (saying he will no longer engage in flings while keeping the flings as contacts) means you do need to take some protective measures. You can go for the ""every 3 months"" rule to catch it quickly if something is passed to you, or you can go for a more conservative schedule of every 6 months. I don\'t recommend hiding this from your husband, and you can say something like ""I need to protect my own health. I know nothing about the sexual behavior I may be exposed to.""', 'created_utc': 1690676979.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'ju0hgu2', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_15bvk1g', 'parent_id': 't1_jtvspf7', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15bvk1g/how_to_word_a_request_to_delete_contacts/ju0hgu2/', 'score': 5, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='Jenneapolis'), 'body': 'I have seen your post history and I think you have bigger fish to fry than worrying about who he has in his phone.

Instead of looking up a list and trying to follow it to a ‚ÄúT‚Äù, a better use of OPs (or anyone in the situation of talking about their ex on a date) time might be questioning or exploring why she still has the desire to bring up her ex - is she still angry with him?

What can OP do to work on that *underling unhealthiness*/insecurity, instead of just following a rule book that says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk about money on a first date‚Äù? \n\nIt is relatively easy to have great ‚Äúgirl game‚Äù, and following lists can be a way to have consistently good first/second dates. However‚Ä¶ those lists are, in my mind, the emotional equivalent of heavy-duty spanx! They suck everything in and smooth everything out‚Ä¶ but eventually, he will see all the lumps and bumps.

Our actions can shape our minds as well as the reverse. \n\nWearing spanx and waist trainers is similar.

This is best done through fixing your eating habits.** Prioritize lean protein (chicken, fish, lean cuts of pork and beef). Half of your plate should be lean protein, a quarter can be veggies, and the other quarter can be carbs (ideally low density carbs like rice, potatoes, or barley). If every plate looks like this, you will probably lose weight without having to count a single calorie/macro. I\'m a fan of dieting in the easiest way **for you**.\n\nOne of the most successful ways to diet is through Intermittent Fasting (IF). Now, there\'s nothing magical about it in terms of weight loss, it\'s merely a lifestyle change that is easy to upkeep and easy to follow. Considering your difficulty is likely the snacking throughout the day (factually speaking), restricting your eating time will absolutely avoid this - if you stick to your plan. Your \'eating window\' could reasonably be anywhere from 4-6 hours and you would likely find yourself in a caloric deficit. Still, I highly recommend following the super basic plate system I detailed above during your eating window. It is important to understand that **just because you are fasting, doesn\'t mean that you will lose weight**. You still need to be in a caloric deficit; hence why food selection is important here. Choose healthy foods; I don\'t need to go into detail here - you know what\'s healthy and what isn\'t.\n\nApproach any diet plan you choose as if it were a lifestyle choice. Frankly, because if you look at it through the lens of ""I only have to do this for xxx days, then I\'m done"" - you will end up back where you started.\n\n**An important note**: if you get the bad/tempting foods out of your house, it\'s MUCH harder to eat them.\n\nOh, and caffeine helps. A lot. If you have sleep issues like insomnia, maybe avoid caffeine \\~12 hours before you go to bed and it should be out of your system. Your mileage may vary.\n\n# Training\n\nAs for staying fit - this is REALLY goal dependent. I personally recommend [Phraks Greyskull LP](https://physiqz.com/workout-routines/powerbuilding-programs/greyskull-lp-best-powerbuilding-routine-beginners-gslp/) for everyone, with the only changes that MEN should add one Biceps exercise after every workout, and WOMEN should add one Glute exercise after every workout and change Deadlifts to Romanian Deadlifts (RDL). This is to get you strong in every direction (Primary Movement Pattern) and provide a solid baseline for your strength/skill, should you want to step up your fitness goals to something more extreme. I\'m partial to lifting weights as having a baseline of muscle helps keep fat off in the long term, and I think strong women are sexy.\n\nIf lifting weights isn\'t your style, women seem to have a better physiological response to CrossFit style training than men do (both are incredible athletes). Try [WODWell](https://wodwell.com/) for a huge list of free (and paid for) workouts that typically take less than 20 minutes (but are quite a breakoff session). If you REALLY wanted to one-up your game, combine a WOD (Workout Of the Day) with the Phraks Greyskull LP program listed above; CrossFitters often run a strength template alongside their WODs for physique/strength goals.\n\nOR you could simply take the kids out on a 20 minute power walk in the morning, every morning. Do yoga/pilates/zumba/whatever. Sorry, I ignore these categorically because it outright does not align with my goals whatsoever. BUT you never really see unfit people doing these things... take that for what it\'s worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, last thing: Take a picture of yourself (shirtless, in undergarments or something that you can see most of your body in), and save it just for you. **When** you lose this weight, you will be REALLY happy you have that picture - I promise. This one is always a hard one for women... **do it**. The whole \'body positivity\' thing really doesn\'t help here; you can\'t lie your way into liking the way you look when you don\'t. You will be really proud of yourself when you lose that weight, but without that picture - you won\'t be able to brag about how far you\'ve come. Give your kids a story and a role model to emulate when they get older.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nu/Important-Future-518\'s post reminded me. I really hate to be the person that just drops a youtube link and says ""watch this"", but this video is immensely helpful for creating the dopamine feedback loop that you will likely need to rely on in order to help you meet your fitness goals. I know the speaker is a meathead (like me), but he is speaking absolute truths and I highly recommend watching this, if you are lacking in the motivation/determination/commitment department for this (I know I was).\n\n[https://youtu.be/bcKthx5LTbI](https://youtu.be/bcKthx5LTbI)\n\nFWIW, I bought their dieting book, cook books, training program, and scientific hypertrophy book at my own expense and have watched many Renaissance Periodization videos.

It\'s impossible to say if it\'s awkwardness, nervousness, low self-esteem, appearance issues, or something else that impacted your date, but you NEED for dates to become a normal thing in your brain and not a big build up with lots of pressure and high stakes.\n\nGo on a bunch of day dates (not nighttime/with alcohol), like for lunch or coffee. Like seriously a bunch. Use an app if you aren\'t already, and expand your search radius if there\'s a local volume issue. You may have to put a lot more effort via travel time in than feels reasonable, but think of it as effort you\'re putting into fixing a social difficulty that will serve you for life rather than effort into just a date.\n\nLine them up and don\'t worry about finding someone you ""like"" with drawn out conversation before arranging the date. A good line is, ""Text is so limited. I like to get to know someone better over coffee."" (And do practice basic ""meeting an internet stranger"" safety by making sure a friend you\'re supposed to check in with after has the guy\'s info.)\n\nI do not advise doing anything physical for a while. I\'d say your self-esteem needs a lot of building up before you can decide what to do with that. Personally I waited until 23 for my first kiss, 25 for everything else, and in neither case do I regret the *waiting*. (I do think I did not make a good first kiss choice, but that\'s besides the point - I didn\'t miss out on something by not kissing guys before him.)

It isn't built, it's *earned* through accomplishment. Guys already know this because we don't get shit without effort. Women get loads of false self esteem ladled onto them from society for things they're born with - looks, fertility, sex, etc. \n\nAnd if you're not one of the extroverted or pretty women of the world, if you're shy, and you aren't encouraged to become accomplished, then you're going to feel pretty worthless.\n\nThing is, that has a relatively easy fix. And it's an RP fix, too.\n\n**Become worthy**.\n\nDo things that raise your value, both in terms of RMV, and in terms of being a human being. Volunteer. Learn to cook. Learn to clean. Set a goal, and meet it. Join a club. Learn a skill. Read a book cover to cover. \n\nIn short, do things that add to your knowledge and skills and abilities. Do things that add worth to you as a participating member of the human race. Because as you add accomplishment upon accomplishment, you stand firm and comfortable upon them because they're earned, they're things you did, things you invested in. They aren't the ephemeral praises of know-nothing others, they're YOURS. No one can take that away from you.\n\nIn a way, you're blessed. You haven't been blinded by meaningless external praises like lots of young women, for whom The Wall is real, merciless, and sudden. You don't have an overinflated ego that will come crashing down as reality hits at age 30. The only way you have left to go is UP, via real accomplishments.\n\nWhich, incidentally, is how mature RP women manage to soften the reality of the Wall, btw. RPW learn skills and continually add value to their relationships, often by growing into the role of mothers and wives, which keeps their worth high to their husbands as their looks fade. THEY age gracefully.\n\nYou have the opportunity to do the same, by learning those skills now.

Deliaallmylife,Endorsed Contributor,DISCUSSION,"[{'author': Redditor(name='ArkNemesis00'), 'body': 'I posted a comment with my thoughts on this the other day!\n\n> To get a man to commit to marriage, he either has to 1) want marriage for his own benefit or 2) want marriage for his partner\'s benefit. A woman can make a strategy that appeals to either motivation. The first is primarily positive motivation - marry me, and you will get ____, the second is primarily negative motivation - marry me, or I will leave/nag you/become unhappy.\n\n> Doing ""wifely actions"" detracts from the first option, him wanting marriage for himself, because he has what he wants now. Stating that you are withholding: sex, living together, combining finances, domestic chores, having children, etc gives them a clear motivation to tie the knot. Of course, if they decide the present relationship is not enough to make them happy, or they don\'t believe their situation will improve upon getting married, you run the risk of them dumping you. \n\n> However, ""wifely actions"" can benefit a woman pursuing a second strategy to motivate a man to keep what he already has. Men do want to see their partners happy, and have the ability to know a good thing when they see it. In this second strategy, it can be more important to have conversations about how much you value marriage and what your timeline looks like.\n\n> I believe there is plenty of room to display your skills and entice your man without stepping into domestic care. Cooking the occasional fancy meal or batch of cookies is quite different than meal planning for the week, grocery shopping, cooking multiple meals a day, etc. I wouldn\'t recommend taking over a man\'s laundry or meal prep, for instance - it\'s enough to have a conversation about what you both want to contribute to the household after marriage.\n\nI think there\'s space to motivate your partner with a combination of these two strategies.', 'created_utc': 1690382904.0, 'edited': 1690384775.0, 'id': 'jtj22li', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_15a4qzq', 'parent_id': 't3_15a4qzq', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/15a4qzq/discussion_wife_privileges/jtj22li/', 'score': 44, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='penapple_2319'), 'body': ""My cliff notes version.

I think it\'s okay to feel the way you\'re feeling. It\'s normal to want connection and companionship. I\'m also always comparing myself as well. Like there\'s zero reason why a guy would choose me when there are better women out there that offer way more than I ever could. And on top on that, I know I have self esteem issues and I\'ve been with a therapist for 5 years but I still think I\'m literal scum. Working on your self esteem is no easy thing. \n\nNow, maybe here are some things I think could help. First of all: be easy on yourself. Remember that it\'s okay to feel the way you feel but here\'s the catch, don\'t let it consume you. Don\'t let yourself feel so sad to the point of hopelessness. Don\'t let desperation get a hold on you and make you in turn make bad decisions. I know it\'s easier said than done but remember, comparing yourself is quite illogical. Think if it this way: you plant two different trees at the same time and check their growth. There\'s tree A and tree B. As time goes by, you notice tree A is taller than tree B. Tree A also looks more vibrant than tree B. It\'s easy to assume that then tree A is ""better"". But when you check on tree B you notice that actually the soil it was planted on is way harder and way dry. Tree A\'s soil is rich on minerals and quite the opposite of dry. Tree B is surrounded by weeds and all sorts of invasive plants. Tree A isn\'t. You then realize that against all odds tree B managed to thrive despite having really bad conditions. If anything, this proves that tree B is stronger than tree A.\nSame with humans. We really don\'t know what each of us experiences or deals with on a daily basis. But you are stronger than you realize. It\'s easy to see the surface and compare our selves based on surface level things. I encourage you to think about the roots and the environment conditions. Even if we experience the same things, each of us is affected differently by that.\n\nSince you also said you are working on your faith, I encourage you to ask God for the right man and that he brings him to you.

First off, there is no right or wrong, this is a personal preference for how you feel comfortable in your space. I remember my parents dropping off the boxes of trophies and photos as well. I had what southerners call a ‚Äúhope chest‚Äù where I stored all this so it was there but hidden. \n\nThat being said, if your goal is to develop a space that feels grown-up, mature, and comfortable to host a man in, then displaying the stuff probably isn‚Äôt going to help you reach that goal. Of course keeping a family photo around makes sense but childhood trophies for example feel a bit like living in the past vs living for the future (to me). And the older you get, the less attached you will be to this kind of stuff.

No, you both have to invest in each other and show each other that you are *capable* of being a good partner so that they will actually **choose** to be with you in the long run.

This is not the case, men take the proposal very seriously. By the time a man proposes he is already set on marriage and the engagement period is not a test but more like a formality, more for securing funds for the wedding and planning for the wedding & marriage and living arrangements, etc. It's like the administration/planning period. Meeting the parents happens *before* the proposal. Often (not necessarily for religious couples) cohabitation comes *before* the proposal. Learning each other's income/financial habits comes *before* the proposal. etc etc.\n\nI can't imagine a man in this day and age that would propose without being completely confident.

Scenario 2: You've been in a serious relationship for one year. While you're out, you're approached by another eligible man that you would normally be interested in. Do you feel differently because your boyfriend hasn't proposed yet?

Obviously you shouldn't cheat, but is there a way to go about this, or is it a simple ""no."" I know loyalty is a big value in RP, so should women close themselves off to other men altogether?

**Conclusion: 
(1) Men expect an exclusive relationship even before engagement. 
(2) Casually dating (without sex) each other until engagement is a ridiculous request.
(3) If another man approaches you, too bad you have to be loyal.**

Dehydrated_Jellyfish,,ADVICE,"[{'author': Redditor(name='MrNifty'), 'body': 'Your friend demonstrates the classic signs of avoidant attachment style. Here are the giveaways:\n\n1. She enjoys a lot of attention from men but is still single.\n2. High and rigid standards. Keeps finding reasons to reject men, but basically says ""if he\'s perfect then I will commit""\n3. She bailed on a long-term relationship just as it was about to get ""serious"". In her mind had she gotten married she would be trapped, no matter going back.\n4. Years and years together with a man and was never sexually intimate with him. Sexually intimacy would\'ve led to emotional intimacy which she is loathe to avoid.\n\nIf you want to help her I would first brush up on the topic yourself. There is a book Attached by Levine and Heller on Amazon. It\'s a great primer to the topic, very easy to read, and lots of great example-stories. I would suggest buying it, reading it, and trying to get her to read it as well by loaning it to her.\n\nBut keep in mind the root issue with avoidant types is repressed emotions. She may be dead set on not ""going there"" in which case there is nothing you can do. So be sure to have some healthy threshold in mind for yourself, in terms of how far you will go to help her.\n\nSomething worth considering is the angle of approach. What would her soft spot be in this regard? Is it appealing to her empathy and how much frustration and pain she has caused others? Or appealing to her intellect and how little sense her stance makes from a rational perspective? Or her religious beliefs, namely that Jesus intended for his children to come together and would want her to face her fears so she could overcome this?\n\nAvoidants have their work cut out for them, and she may benefit from an experienced therapist on this matters.', 'created_utc': 1690173143.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'jt7lqpp', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_157zh4c', 'parent_id': 't3_157zh4c', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/157zh4c/gal_pals_with_44f_who_is_single_because_she_keeps/jt7lqpp/', 'score': 44, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='Dehydrated_Jellyfish'), 'body': 'Wow, This is overall a really great comment!

Even a *PASTOR* wouldn‚Äôt meet these criteria, as typically a pastor only serves one church - and is perhaps one of several pastors on a ministry team!\n\nIt sounds like she really either a) doesn‚Äôt know what she wants or b) DOES know what she wants - to enjoy her single asexual life, casually date, but never have to move beyond the social dating phase of a relationship. Her situation and behavior is not normal for her age - and I say this coming from a conservative Christian background myself, not so much an ‚Äúof the world‚Äù sense of normal. Her actions are not aligned with her words, so there is either something she is not telling you, or something she knows deep down but is unwilling to admit to herself (she may be asexual, demisexial, aromantic, or have trauma around her sexuality/ability to connect to men that she has either repressed, or is unwilling to unpack). \n\nI think at this point, you are more than OK to set a boundary that you are not going to be the ‚Äúdating advice dispenser‚Äù and that dating might just not be a healthy topic for you guys to bond over. \n\nIf you are to offer her any more advice, I would go in with some words from the Apostle Paul, who says in 1 Corinthians 7:32-35‚Ä¶\n\n*I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord‚Äôs affairs‚Äîhow he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world‚Äîhow he can please his wife‚Äî and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord‚Äôs affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world‚Äîhow she can please her husband. I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.*\n\nIt is absolutely acceptable to be single forever, and live a life devoted to religious service. It is also absolutely acceptable to get married and live in a married way with your husband. But she shouldn‚Äôt feel pressure to continue dating or seeking for a husband if she has no desire or if there isn‚Äôt a man who will meet her criteria‚Ä¶ and her saying that God will bring her a husband is absolutely false! He makes no such promise that every woman will have a husband, or every man will have a wife‚Ä¶ it may not be in Gods plan for her to be married, and at this point it may be best to accept that this is her position. Again, if it is causing you frustration, please set a boundary with her and focus on your own growth and development - it sounds like she has some underlying stuff to work through on her own.', 'created_utc': 1690200734.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'jt8ncjg', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_157zh4c', 'parent_id': 't3_157zh4c', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/157zh4c/gal_pals_with_44f_who_is_single_because_she_keeps/jt8ncjg/', 'score': 8, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='Dehydrated_Jellyfish'), 'body': 'I like that you high lighted the hypocrisy as you are correct, even a pastor wouldn‚Äôt live up to the standards.

When the drama dies down and things are calm there is more time to think. This can mean facing things in their lives that they want to avoid and bury. Unfortunately, no amount of drama and distraction will keep underlying issues at bay for good. Eventually they will need to deal with whatever problems they may have or have had. The anxiety that arises from these issues will typically produce a chaos response that provides the needed relief.*\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/blog/drama-kings-queens-why-some-people-seem-to-live-for-crisis#3', 'created_utc': 1690209170.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'jt953zn', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_157zh4c', 'parent_id': 't1_jt92kef', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/157zh4c/gal_pals_with_44f_who_is_single_because_she_keeps/jt953zn/', 'score': 2, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='spruceofalltrades'), 'body': 'It‚Äôs sunk cost fallacy.

We all have different gifts and temptations for example, and our walk with God is highly unique. I think it is reasonable for her to hold out for a man with a strong faith, and agrees on salvation issues, but at some point ‚Äúthe perfect is the enemy of the good‚Äù. She needs to go through her list of theological criteria and cross off anything that isn‚Äôt a salvation issue. Unity in the essentials, harmony in all else. \n\nOn that note, level of religious practice looks different for everyone. Maybe he only attends 1 church, but is an elder or pastor and runs several groups there, regularly fasts and gives alms, and spends hours daily in prayer and Bible study. We should not ‚Äúflirt to convert‚Äù but Christian marriage is about growing in holiness together. Rather than seeking a man superior to her in every single way, look for one who is strong where she is weak, and working to improve where he is weak. A single man doesn‚Äôt need to be a spiritual leader the way a husband and father does. One way Christian women practicing premarital abstinence can bring value to a relationship and demonstrate our RMV is by encouraging and inspiring him (never demanding or commanding) to build up his own faith. We need to give men the opportunity to step into that leadership role. \n\nFor Biblical arguments, I would point out that singleness can be a deliberate choice to further God‚Äôs kingdom. A lot of Protestant churches tend to de-emphasize this especially for women, but choosing to focus on doing God‚Äôs work is an option. But if she‚Äôs single and pining for a man, that‚Äôs not the gift of singleness. Encourage her to either turn it over to God completely and accept she may never marry, or to take a more proactive approach in finding a husband by working through her resistance. 1 Corinthians 7 is a good passage for understanding the role of singles in the church. \n\nFurthermore, her choosiness and rejecting eligible men may be acting as a way for her to try to take control of her own romantic life, rather than entrusting it to God. Like the story of the drowning man who turned down the lifeboats because ‚ÄúGod will save me‚Äù, when God was trying to save him by sending the lifeboats. Your friend sounds like she could benefit from the ‚Äúdate them till you hate them‚Äù approach. If she spent more time with that man, she may very well have grown more attracted to him and been willing to overlook certain things, but she didn‚Äôt give herself the chance. Accepting a date with a man vetted for safety is fairly low risk, high reward. She doesn‚Äôt have anything to lose by seeing him again. \n\nAcross all denominations, women tend to be more involved in the daily life of the church for several reasons: SAHMs have more time during the day when most men are at work, women being more social means we have a greater need to build communities, empty nester and widowed women turning to the church as an outlet for the nurturing they previously gave their family. You could bring this up and encourage her to not judge men by comparing them to women. \n\nOk this has already been a long post and it may be a stretch, but is it possible her idea of submission is at the core of her avoidance? Some churches and believers hold the unbiblical idea that men are, by virtue of their maleness, inherently superior to all women in every way, and this can lead to Christian women having low self worth or unrealistic expectations for a husband. If this is the case, study the passages on submitting in marriage carefully with her, looking at WHY that is commanded of us. It‚Äôs not because the husbands are superior in every way, it‚Äôs because this is our unique responsibility given to us by God, just as leadership is theirs. \n\nI can relate to the fear of ‚Äúif he‚Äôs not better than me at everything and stronger in every aspect of faith, how will I be able to submit to him?‚Äù The answer is that husbands sacrificing, wives submitting, and parents providing, and children obeying are unique ways in which we are called to show Christ‚Äôs love. 1 John 4:19 ‚Äúwe love because He first loved us‚Äù. None of us deserve God‚Äôs love, but He gives it freely and that inspires us to become better people through His help. She already has a man who is perfect and better than her in every way- Jesus.

It\'s really something I\'d save for very serious issues or sometimes when I\'m PMSing I argue for the hell of it. It introduces a very undesirable dynamic with my boyfriend where we physically pull away from each other and afterwards I feel unloved, even if I ""win"". And next day I can\'t remember what we were even debating.\n\nI think you should understand that you will probably never beat a man physically and if you do, you will lose attraction to him. Additionally, this shyness/fear will probably evaporate as you get to know the man better and figure out that he won\'t hurt you. That can be a double edged sword as you could lose attraction or change the dynamic. \n\nRegarding initial meetings, I think taking it slow is best. Maybe don\'t argue with them until you meet in person? The stark difference between online and in person is going to confuse them. Also, just accept that you are smaller/weaker and treat them accordingly. I think your mental block is coming from the discrepancy between your attitude and your physical strength. You\'ve realised that you are not as tough as you thought you were and can\'t walk the talk. Your attitude is based on being a physical equal but that is not the case in reality. So you are humbled and experiencing a situation where your idea of yourself is not concordant with physical reality.\n\nThe truth is these guys can beat you in an arm wrestle, or worse. I used to be scared of men too. At first I tried to intimidate *them* with my attitude and my speech - I think I scared a few honestly. But that wasn\'t who I was. Now I just treat them respectfully and give them the appropriate distance until I know them better and can decide if I want to be vulnerable (or alone) with one.\n\nIt was much worse when I was young and it\'s better now. For reference, am shorter than 5 foot, and my boyfriend is 6 foot. I work with older bigger men so I had to get used to going on car trips with men, deferring to men, relating to men. It took a good couple of years. Being soft gets me much further than being hard. Problem is, if you\'re soft, they will treat you protectively which can feel wrong if you\'re used to thinking you can take care of yourself. I had to accept that there were limits to what I can do (can barely do push up right now and see aforementioned height)  and sometimes I need protection.

DraftTrick9559,,DISCUSSION,"[{'author': Redditor(name='StrangestUnicorn'), 'body': 'I haven\'t read this book specifically, but I have read his earlier book ""Evolution of Desire"" and some other literature he has coauthored many years ago. \n\nIt is important to keep in mind a common critique of evolutionary psychology, that it is a very speculative field, with most of its theories being neither provable nor falsifiable.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in deterioration of men\'s Red Pill has been their increasingly loose interpretation of evo-psych which they conveniently cheery pick to justify many of their existing biases and beliefs. While I\'m happy to see that RPW has not gone done the same rabbit-hole, there is still a danger for anyone diving into this field for the first time of naively reducing human behavior and relationships down to innate biological drives, and cherry picking theories that confirm one\'s existing world view.\n\nI still think being aware of biological differences and their evolutionary origins is a valuable knowledge to have, though one does have to exercise caution when engaging with evo-psych theories, especially the unsubstantiated online discourse.', 'created_utc': 1690084426.0, 'edited': False, 'id': 'jt2xhkl', 'is_submitter': False, 'link_id': 't3_1572z8m', 'parent_id': 't3_1572z8m', 'permalink': '/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1572z8m/a_book_recommendation_rpw_should_pick_up/jt2xhkl/', 'score': 12, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xing'}, {'author': Redditor(name='DraftTrick9559'), 'body': 'The essence of science is in the fact that even theories are not proof. But YES! One of the main reasons I enjoyed reading this book was because it was by Dr. Buss.

However, I\'m hesitant to list it as a general recommendation, amongst other books recommended on this sub. For me, evolutionary psychology literature is a case-by-case recommendation. There are people in my social circle I know would benefit from reading Buss et al, and yet there are others I would steer away from it.\n\nI think that evolutionary perspective on gender dynamics is most useful for people who already have relationship experience, which allows them to gain a more nuanced understanding of their past and present experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, I am hesitant to recommend it to younger people who did not have many close friendships or relationships with people of the opposite gender. While it is of course a very interesting read, I do not think that, for them, it offers much practical utility, and for some can even be harmful, as it can often reinforce unhealthy stereotypes or biologically reductionist thinking, no matter how many warnings they receive.\n\nA lot of the value in understanding gender differences can be gained from more traditional relationship literature that focuses on exploring said differences, such as Harley\'s ""His Needs, Her Needs"" or Feldhahn\'s ""[For Women Only](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cndeb/for_women_only_i_read_books_so_you_dont_have_to/)"" and ""For Men Only"", to name a few. While these books do not explain why those differences exist, nor do they explore the full extent of those differences, they nonetheless give a good foundation for people who are new to Red Pill or to dating in general in gaining practical knowledge to improve their relationships, without any significant risks or downsides.\n\nI have definitely found Buss\'s previous work insightful, and this post has reminded me to read ""When Men Behave Badly"" as well. I\'ve listened to him talking about the book on several podcasts, and have followed the academic work produced by his lab, so I was dragging my feet to actually read the book.

So this is something that has been bothering me for a few days and I'm not sure quite how to deal with it.

Last weekend,  we were due to see each other. We don't live together and haven't seen each other a couple weeks now due to illness etc. My mother who I live with had asked why we weren't seeing each other again that weekend to which I replied about illness etc.

Later on while texting SO I happen to relay this conversation to him,  just saying my mother was asking why I wasn't over.  He immediately gets defensive and goes into fight response,  fires some comment back at me. I gently tell him I'm not looking to argue with him,  I was just relaying really.

I'm not sure how to handle and feel a bit vulnerable really . How can I navigate this conversation that I feel this way when he gets defensive? He has nothing to be defensive about,  I'm not controlling, demanding etc. We don't tend to argue or anything so when this defensive stuff happens,  I'm quite taken aback. I feel like oh he's not on my side if that makes sense. 

How would you handle this ?

Thanks",How to deal with when they have a fight/flight response to something that's not an argument?,0.83

In the Barbie world the men are number 2 where in the real world, women are seen as number 2 to the men. Ken saw that in the real world he can be looked at more than just a himbo and wanted to change Barbie world as such. Unfortunately he put the women in the number 2 place. He says to Barbie ""how does it feel?"" meaning he wasn\'t appreciating how the Ken\'s were being treated. But instead of working together the Barbies took back the land and put themselves back in first. This has it\'s good and bad side. The good is yes the women are in a higher position but the men were tossed back down where they have no say in anything. They are accessories to the Barbies. The world isn\'t better in the end when you think on it. It\'s a reversal card on how women felt they were being treated by men in the real world. There is a line that if you miss it, the deal with Barbie and Ken\'s relationship is lost. Gloria said ""I never had a Ken doll"". Ken was head over heels in love with a Barbie that will never love him. He based his whole existence on being with Barbie. That\'s very sad. It\'s a reflection on when Barbie was created, women were raised into thinking their whole existence was to please and marry a man. Barbie changed the game but didn\'t make it 100% better. Yes, women feel more liberated and in more power than we were back in the 50s. But in Barbie\'s world, men will always be an accessory. That\'s a bad message to send to women. Men and women should never feel like an accessory. That was the point.

Can\'t women just make movies that are fun? Does everything--even comedy--need to have a deeper meaning (that isn\'t even well-done or subtle, but in your face with lazy writing)?

They get depicted as being more badass, violent, and competent than the male characters around them. But nobody ever really empowers the classic feminine qualities anymore like being compassionate and understanding and I\'m frankly getting tired of only seeing angry tomboys in media anymore. It feels like women are expected to act like this now and that acting quiet, compassionate and gentle instead of being a loud, rude badass means being weak and I hate that young girls have to grow up with these new values that expect them to take charge and never ask for help.

I thought that, with the Ken takeover, it was predicting the Redpill male backlash to feminism, but maybe that was me reading into it too much.

I thought it was sad that Barbies had to rule in the end. I wish they could have come to an equal mode of government. Or, at the very least, stopped seeing Kens as inferior. I know it was supposed to be a commentary about ""positive masculinity"" but it didn't satisfy me personally.

It was feminist but I still enjoyed it mostly.",What did y'all think of the Barbie movie?,0.79

Dehydrated_Jellyfish,,THEORY,"[{'author': Redditor(name='StrangestUnicorn'), 'body': 'This is indeed good advice. However I would not attribute this to ""femininity"". She is a fun and engaging conversationalist and talks about ""positivity"", which never sounds bad coming from anyone. If an 82 year old man said the exact same words, it would sound equally as good.\n\nAs for mystery and lack of communication, I do not think that they are ""women\'s strength"" specifically. You can hear about the ""mystery method"" all the way back in the pick-up artist community from over a decade ago. When paired with a positive outlook on life, it communicates maturity and satisfaction with one\'s own being, which is neither  masculine nor feminine, but is an alluring trait in all people.\n\nAlso, I do not think her message was that it is better ""to not know"" or ""to not care to look for facts"". This is where that ""mid wit"" meme is relevant, insofar as there exists an unhappy valley in the middle, and the people on either side of it are the happiest. There is a period in all of our lives when we abandon the naive idealism of our childhood, and are confronted with all the unsolvable problems of human existence, which renders many of us cynical and nihilistic. And this cynicism is often expressed through depression, anxiety or anger.\n\nShe is right that people who are in that valley are unhappy. Yet, I do not think that her solution, were she asked, is to remain in naive ignorance, but to overcome the valley of cynicism, and to emerge on the other side equipped with tools to live a happy and fulfilling lives despite being aware of many reasons not to.

**Nun Mode Age: 17**

**Nun Mode Duration: 1 year**


##What Brought Me To Nun Mode:

In my late teens, I experienced some of the greatest failures of my young life to date:

I can't go into too much detail, but I had a monumental academic failure that derailed my life track. I lost a lot of friends indirectly because of this.

I also failed to turn down a nice guy I wasn't attracted to my junior year of highschool. We ""dated"" for a couple months. I ended things because I knew I was terrible for seeing someone I wasn't that excited about - there was another guy in my heart that I couldn't let go of. I was angry at myself for doing something I knew was a mistake *before I did it*. It felt like I was growing more immature with age.

Luckily, shortly after these events, my family relocated. Homeschooling became the best way for me to finish high school. This time at home, away from my peers, ended up being one of my favorite years of my life.

##Celibacy:

Spending this year without boys was big for me, I spent so much of my middle and high school years having little crushes. My nun mode marked a transition from juvenile love to dating with intention of marriage. I was always pretty dead set on getting married and having kids young. Taking this time away from high school boys put me in the right frame of mind to do it.

I spent a lot of time pining after ""the one that got away"" during this year. I had displayed a lot of immaturity the year prior in my losing quest to win this guy's heart. It was good for me to be alone and reflect.

After I turned 18, I start dating with a (mostly) healed heart. I had some good learning experiences, some not-so-good ones. After some years passed, I reached out to the boy I had fallen head over heels for in high school and we started to date. I give my time in nun mode a lot of credit for setting me down a good path.

##Self-reflection:

I spent a lot of time with myself during this year. Sometimes I'd wake up and just lay in bed and sit with my thoughts for an hour or so. Other times I'd hang out in a very peaceful and beautiful place, like church, and let my mind wander. It led to a good sense of self. I enjoyed my own company.

I thought a lot about what I wanted in life. I changed my career path to prioritize someday being a SAHM. I would Google things like ""what is the ideal wife"" and ""what do men want in a woman"". I took note of the answers. 

Most of my time was spent with people older than me, wiser than me, who had what I wanted in life. My family were/are people who want the best for me and who want me to be the best version of myself. The time I spent improving my familiar relationships has been a great benefit to me since, especially once I started having kids. 

##Self-improvement:

####Improving Strengths:

During this time, I started a new hobby from scratch (video-editing). Not only was this fun and fulfilling then, I've actually used this quite a bit since. Very cool.

I also inproved upon one of my existing hobbies (jewelry-making) until I felt my skill went from hobbyist to semi-professional. This has not come in handy too much, but I can repair broken store-bought pieces and occasionally make handmade gifts.

I read some interesting classic novels and short stories. Frankenstein, The Great Gatsby, and Rebecca come to mind, all of which I really liked. This kind of thing really expands one's mind without you even realizing it. I don't read as much lately, and I feel the loss of it.

####Mitigating Weaknesses:

After my massive academic failure at 16, I knew I needed to make some changes. I had always been smart but had no idea how to study. I had never so much as opened a textbook.With homeschooling, I was 100% responsible for my education. It was all textbooks and online quizzes, which I loved. I needed to become disciplined for this to work, something I was aware I was sorely lacking, and I managed to step up to the plate.

Years later, I'm still so grateful for this chance to succeed on my own terms. Discipline went from something I was embarrassed about, to something I can be proud of. I regularly research things I don't know and teach myself new skills. Being able to self-learn is an incredible gift.

Sometimes my family could spit some pretty scathing remarks about my personality. I tried to take this to heart. It was important to me that my future husband **loved** being around me. I was willing to put in some work to make sure this was the case. Most notably, I can be stubborn and hot-tempered. Though it took a bit longer than just this one year of nun mode, I watched instinces of me being a big conflict-causing pain-in-the-butt drop from roughly once a month to closer to once a year.

##Summary:

I spent one whole year with no boys and no drama. Just people who loved me, who wanted me to succeed in love and life, and who would give me sometimes brutal feedback about my personality flaws.

I spent most of my time doing things I liked, exploring topics I was interested in, and reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I rerouted my plans for college and career, worked part time, and saved up some money.

##Concluding My Nun Mode:

If I could do it all over again...I would tell myself to learn how to vet. I wish I could've skipped the guy I dated at 18 and spend a second year in nun mode. A bad relationship set me back more than it helped me learn. If it's not a ""hell yes""...

**Note:**

I didn't make any SMV changes during this time. I did, however, drop 20 pounds about a year later. This did have a positive effect on my dating life as well as the RMV changes I made at 17.",FR: My Time in Nun Mode as a Teen,0.89
